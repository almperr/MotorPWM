# MotorPWM
### Overview
This is C code used to create a PWM drive. This project demonstrates the use of an Enhanced Capture Timer (ECT) in a Task Scheduler. A DC brushless motor is controlled using dipswitches. One switch turns the motor on and off. A second switch changes speed from slow to fast. The speed is controlled by changing the Pulse Width of the power signal sent to the motor. For slow, its a 30% duty cycle; For fast, its 90%. Another task of this project was to program a set of 3 LEDs to flash in a sequence driven by the ECT. LED 1 toggles on/off every 0.1 seconds; LED 2 every 0.2 seconds; LED 3 every 2 seconds. This code was created using Code Warrior IDE. This was a project for ECET 309, Advanced Embedded Micro-Controllers.
